### Personal Hell - A Doom WAD view for MacOS

This was just a quick shot at learning something new, inspired by a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV-cSvFM3ak) from Coder Space on doing the same in Python. You should check it out as they actually explain what's going on.

Also tried to incorporate [The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) by the lovely people over at [Point Free](https://www.pointfree.co).

Includes the original Doom shareware WAD file to get started. I think that's ok? Let me know if it's a no-no.
